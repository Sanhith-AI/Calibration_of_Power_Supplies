# Calibration_of_Power_Supplies
This project is to calibrate the power supplies using the SSE calibration station.
To run the code, open the main.c file in the folder Core, followed by Src, with the STM32CUBE IDE.
To configure peripherals and other parameters, open the file calibration_of_power_supplies.ioc either with the CubeMX application or the STM32CUBE IDE itself and configure according to requirements.
To transmit and receive serial data from and to the main microcontroller, open the file example1.pro with QT Creator. The file is located in the GUI application folder.
Use the QT5.12 version to run the GUI application
